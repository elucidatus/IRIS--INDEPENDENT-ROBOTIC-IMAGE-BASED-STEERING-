# IRIS--INDEPENDENT-ROBOTIC-IMAGE-BASED-STEERING-
An attempt at self driving cars using image proccessing

Backstory: I made this in 2015. The project uses image processing to find the center line of a lane/road 

Compiler: Visual Studio 2012 C#
Optional Application: VEX Robotics Controller (on PC)

Instructions: 
Input an image of a road, as found in the bin/Debug/bmp files. Run the program.
When using Vex robotics, mount a camera (read:webcam) ontop of it and use a computer (PC) as an intermediary.
